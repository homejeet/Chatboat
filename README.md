# Chatboat
**In order to create a chatbot, or really do any machine learning task, of course, the first job you have is to acquire training data, then you need to structure and prepare it to be formatted in a "input" and "output" manner that a machine learning algorithm can digest. Arguably, this is where all the real work is when doing just about any machine learning. The building of a model and training/testing steps are the easy parts!**
For getting chat training data, there are quite a few resources you could look into. For example, there is the Cornell movie dialogue corpus that seems to be one of the most popular. There are many other sources, but I wanted something that was more... raw. Something a little less polished... something with some character to it. Naturally, this took me to Reddit.
Raddit data is available just download its 5GB file load it to database as if memory does not support in my case memory is not sufficient so insert data into database.
Next preprocesse data to some form.
**CHATBOAT  THIS IS NOT YET COMPLETE ON WORKING**
